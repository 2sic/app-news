## Customize the App

The News App has an important app setting which you can configure with the ["Configure Main-List and Details Page" checklist](https://azing.org/2sxc/r/SGLKKOiE). But it also has a lot of app resources you can change if you want to.

If you want to customize the CSS, you will usually follow the ["Create Custom Styles in a Standard 2sxc App" checklist](https://azing.org/2sxc/r/gg_aB9FD)
